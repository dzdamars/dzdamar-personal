<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I graduated from SMKN 1 Cibinong, and currently studying in Computer Science from the Mercu Buana University. I have been working as a developer and programmer for over two years and have been working as a offensive cyber security for over one years.</p>

<p>In my spare time. I always learn how to make a good website, I always learn how to make structured coding and how to protect websites to be safe from hackers.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I always taking time to be a bug hunter, looking for security holes in websites/android apps and then reporting it to the website/android app owner. I really enjoy it, because of that I can also help secure the website from other rogue hackers.</p>
